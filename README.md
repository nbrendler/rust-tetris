# Rust Tetris Clone

This was a learning project where I made tetris in Rust using the ggez
framework.

To play (requires Rust tooling install):

```bash
cargo run
```

There's also tests! The piece moving logic is particularly atrocious so I wrote
tests for it. I would not use that as a reference ;)

```bash
cargo test
```

Most assets I believe I made myself and can be licensed similarly.
